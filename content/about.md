**Hi**,
My name is Parmeshwar Patidar, but go by *Param* among friends.
I am, an IT undergrad, self-driven with a can-do mindset who learns quickly and cares about details,
I find coding in [Go](https://golang.org) *really, really fun*[^1]. `Distributed systems` and `compilers` interest me most.

Apart from being close to monitor, I like to explore the cosmos and play(and watch) cricket.
